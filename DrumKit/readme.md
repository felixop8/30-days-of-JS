# _JavaScript Drum Kit_

#### _A simple vanilla JS project to refresh my JS skills._

#### By _**Félix Oporto**_

## Description

_This project was created using vanilla JS and CSS, it was created as a training exercise to refresh some JS ES6 skills._
## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Just clone the project and open index.html in your browser._

## Technologies Used

Vanilla JS ES6 and CSS


## MVP - User Stories


* _As a user I want to see a list of keyboard letters that corresponds to the keys ASDFGHJKL with their corresponding sound description._
* _As a user I want to stroke a key that corresponds to the list ASDFGHJKL and hear the sound described for each of them and the square should scale and change the border color._



## Things learned working on this little project

* _Learned a new html tag <kbd> that defines a keyboard input. The tag is used when it is needed to display text that the user should enter into their keyboard (for any number of reasons)._

* _Learned a new html tag <audio>, is an inline element used to embed sound files into a web page. It is useful when you want to add any audio, such as a song._

* _I refreshed my memory using transitions and transforms._

* _I used JS querySelector to select element in the dom and manipulate its content and also to add events on them._

* _I learned an event listener (transitionend) that can be triggered when a transition finish, very useful to remove the class from the element._
